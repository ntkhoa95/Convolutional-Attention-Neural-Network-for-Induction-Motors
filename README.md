Implementation of [Effective Fault Diagnosis Based on Wavelet and Convolutional Attention Neural Network for Induction Motors (IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9666871)

## Introduction
This article aims to develop an effective method for motor fault detection using time–frequency contents of vibration signals and an attention-based convolutional neural network model. First, the vibration signals are collected and labeled into five different categories: normal condition, outer ring fault, inner ring fault, misalignment condition, and broken rotor bar. Then, using the Morlet function, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) converts the vibratory time-series signals to the scalogram feature images. The time–frequency feature images are created after downsampling and converting the measured vibration signals to the frequency domain. These images are then resized and fed into the proposed convolutional attention neural network (CANN) to identify various induction motor failures
